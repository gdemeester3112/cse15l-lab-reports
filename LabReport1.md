# These are my examples of using cd,ls and cat without arguments:  

## For cat:


> ![Image](Screenshot cat with no args.png) 

The terminal froze. 


## For ls:  


>![Image](Screenshot ls with no args.png)

This showed the files in the current directory.


## For cd:  


>![Image](Screenshot cd with no args.png)

This made the directory go down to the previous one.  


# These are my examples using cat,ls and cd with a directory as argument:  


## For cat:


>![Image](Screenshot cat with directory as argument.png)


This showed that cat does not work with directory as argument.


## For ls:


>![Image](Screenshot ls with directory as argument.png)


This showed that ls does not move you to the directory but shows you what is inside that directory.


## For cd:


>![image](Screenshot cd with directory as argument.png)



This showed that cd directs you to the directory if you use the directory as argument.


# These are my examples using cat,ls and cd with a file as argument:


## For cat:


>![Image](cat with file as argument.png)

This printed the code from the Hello.java file.


## For ls:


>![Image](ls with file as arg.png)

This showed the name of the file since it is not a directory.


## For cd:


>![Image](cd with file as arg.png)

This didnt work since cd is to direct the user to a directory and since the argument was a file it didnt work.
